 /*Write a description of how to get from the front door of your
dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, to the door of your
classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are
not, pick another target). Have a friend try to follow the
instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she
goes along. To keep friends, it may be a good idea to “field
test” those instructions yourself before giving them to a friend.*/
