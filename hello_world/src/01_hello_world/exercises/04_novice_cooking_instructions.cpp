 /*Find a good cookbook. Read the instructions for baking
blueberry muffins (if you are in a country where “blueberry
muffins” is a strange, exotic dish, use a more familiar dish
instead). Please note that with a bit of help and instruction,
most of the people in the world can bake delicious blueberry
muffins. It is not considered advanced or difficult fine cooking.
However, for the author, few exercises in this book are as
difficult as this one. It is amazing what you can do with a bit of
practice.
• Rewrite those instructions so that each individual action
is in its own numbered paragraph. Be careful to list all
ingredients and all kitchen utensils used at each step. Be
careful about crucial details, such as the desired oven
temperature, preheating the oven, the preparation of the
muffin pan, the way to time the cooking, and the need to
protect your hands when removing the muffins from the
oven.
• Consider those instructions from the point of view of a
cooking novice (if you are not one, get help from a friend
who does not know how to cook). Fill in the steps that
the book’s author (almost certainly an experienced cook)
left out for being obvious.
• Build a glossary of terms used. (What’s a muffin pan?
What does preheating do? What do you mean by
“oven”?)
• Now bake some muffins and enjoy your results.*/
